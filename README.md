# OneEarth_LULUCF-flux_country-level

This repository provides the scripts that were used for the analyses and the figures presented in the publication Schwingshackl et al., Differences in land-based mitigation estimates reconciled by separating natural and land-use CO2 fluxes at the country level.

The folders in this repository contain the following scripts:
- Scripts1_DataPreparation_NaturalSink_TrendyDGVMs: Scripts for preparing and processing the DGVM data of Trendy-v8, Trendy-v9, and Trendy-v10. The scripts produce gridded data (used in Figure 1), and data at the country level.
- Scripts2_DataPreparation_LULUCF_BookkeepingModels: Scripts for preparing the LULUCF fluxes from bookkeeping models and the forest area from the bookkeeping model BLUE.
- Scripts3_Figures: Scripts for preparing data at country level for the figures, and for plotting all figures.
